1
00:00:44,721 --> 00:00:46,556
<i>I'm sorry...</i>

2
00:00:46,556 --> 00:00:48,391
<i>I'm really sorry...</i>

3
00:00:48,758 --> 00:00:52,795
<i>but even if you hate me,
even if you hate me a lot,</i>

4
00:00:52,795 --> 00:00:55,365
<i>can't you stay with me?</i>

5
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,668
<i>Let go.</i>

6
00:00:58,668 --> 00:01:03,072
<i>I feel like every string that kept me 
connected to the world has been detached.</i>

7
00:01:18,488 --> 00:01:21,424
<i>It's really ridiculous...</i>

8
00:01:22,892 --> 00:01:25,828
<i>it really makes no sense...</i>

9
00:01:28,398 --> 00:01:31,701
<i>but I'm always worried about that kid.</i>

10
00:01:39,042 --> 00:01:41,978
I'm really going crazy.

11
00:01:43,446 --> 00:01:45,648
<i>It's really unbelievable...</i>

12
00:01:46,382 --> 00:01:48,951
<i>but I think I like that kid.</i>

13
00:01:48,951 --> 00:01:51,888
What in the world am I going 
to do with you?

14
00:01:54,457 --> 00:01:56,659
<i>So I want to hurry and get over this.</i>

15
00:01:56,659 --> 00:01:58,494
<i>I have to get over it.</i>

16
00:02:01,431 --> 00:02:03,633
<i>I can do it.</i>

17
00:02:06,536 --> 00:02:09,839
-=Episode 12=-
"An Exercise In Memory"

18
00:02:13,176 --> 00:02:15,011
Hey.

19
00:02:20,883 --> 00:02:24,554
Didn't you say I didn't like you 
because you were messy?

20
00:02:25,288 --> 00:02:30,426
Yeah. I cleaned because you always
nagged me.

21
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,198
I don't remember it, but it feels
more comfortable than my own house.

22
00:02:35,198 --> 00:02:37,400
It's only until you get back your memory.

23
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,969
Once you get your memory, 
don't come back here again.

24
00:02:39,969 --> 00:02:42,171
And don't come looking for me again.

25
00:02:47,677 --> 00:02:49,879
Hurry and answer me.

26
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,815
Okay.

27
00:02:56,119 --> 00:02:58,688
You know you're having another
trial soon, right?

28
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:00,890
This time, I can't be your attorney,

29
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:04,927
because the trial won't be in the Yeonju
district, but in the Seoul High Court.

30
00:03:04,927 --> 00:03:07,497
I'm not sure if you'll be found 
innocent this time.

31
00:03:07,864 --> 00:03:09,332
Yes.

32
00:03:09,332 --> 00:03:10,800
That's why...

33
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,002
you have to do whatever you can 
to find your memories.

34
00:03:13,002 --> 00:03:16,304
Think of it as a jigsaw puzzle and put
together as many pieces as you can.

35
00:03:16,304 --> 00:03:18,874
Yes, I will.

36
00:03:22,912 --> 00:03:25,114
Why are your eyes so red?

37
00:03:27,317 --> 00:03:30,987
Since the verdict, I haven't been able
to sleep. I think it's insomnia.

38
00:03:30,987 --> 00:03:32,088
Really?

39
00:03:32,088 --> 00:03:36,859
You used to fall asleep in a second. 
How can you have insomnia?

40
00:03:36,859 --> 00:03:39,062
Is it from stress?

41
00:03:42,365 --> 00:03:45,668
Hey, are you asleep?

42
00:03:47,503 --> 00:03:50,440
I thought you had insomnia.

43
00:03:53,376 --> 00:03:56,679
Hey, go in your room and sleep.

44
00:05:07,517 --> 00:05:11,187
But what lawyer is going to
defend him this time?

45
00:05:13,022 --> 00:05:14,857
Lawyer Cha knows this case.

46
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:16,693
So if Lawyer Cha would do it, 
that would be the best.

47
00:05:16,693 --> 00:05:18,161
Should I try and ask him?

48
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:24,033
I'm crazy, crazy.
How can I be so shameless?

49
00:05:24,033 --> 00:05:26,602
Jang Hye Seong, you're really low. 
A total shit!

50
00:05:28,438 --> 00:05:29,906
That hurts!

51
00:05:33,943 --> 00:05:35,778
But should I do it anyway?

52
00:06:01,104 --> 00:06:03,306
How long did I sleep?

53
00:06:12,482 --> 00:06:15,051
<i>There's curry in the fridge.
Heat it up and eat it.</i>

54
00:06:24,594 --> 00:06:28,998
<i>That's why... you have to do whatever 
you can to find your memories.</i>

55
00:06:28,998 --> 00:06:32,669
<i>Think of it as a jigsaw puzzle and put
together as many pieces as you can.</i>

56
00:06:55,425 --> 00:06:57,627
<i>With Min Jun Guk at the fishery.</i>

57
00:07:06,803 --> 00:07:08,638
<i>Traffic accident alone on the road.</i>

58
00:07:13,042 --> 00:07:14,877
<i>With Lawyer Jang at the aquarium.</i>

59
00:07:49,012 --> 00:07:53,049
No. This is really shameless,
even for me.

60
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,959
But Lawyer Cha is the one I trust
the most.

61
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:11,401
No. People really can't be like this.

62
00:08:16,172 --> 00:08:19,475
But if Su Ha gets stuck with a weirdo
lawyer, then what?

63
00:08:26,082 --> 00:08:27,550
=What are you doing now?=

64
00:08:34,891 --> 00:08:36,359
Lawyer Cha!

65
00:08:36,726 --> 00:08:38,928
Do you have something to say to me?

66
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:43,700
No. Nothing.

67
00:08:45,902 --> 00:08:47,370
Tell me.

68
00:08:48,838 --> 00:08:51,040
No. I can't.

69
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,609
You want to ask me to defend
Pak Su Ha, right?

70
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,381
That must be it.

71
00:08:59,482 --> 00:09:00,950
No.

72
00:09:01,684 --> 00:09:05,355
I thought about it a tiny bit, 
but I gave up.

73
00:09:05,355 --> 00:09:07,557
I'm not quite that shameless.

74
00:09:07,557 --> 00:09:10,126
I feel bad about it, so I can't.

75
00:09:10,126 --> 00:09:10,860
I won't.

76
00:09:11,227 --> 00:09:14,163
I'll do it. Defend Pak Su Ha.

77
00:09:15,631 --> 00:09:16,366
What?

78
00:09:16,366 --> 00:09:18,568
I said I'll be his attorney.

79
00:09:18,568 --> 00:09:21,871
So, I will let Lawyer Jang feel bad for me.

80
00:09:21,871 --> 00:09:24,073
I will let you feel burdened.

81
00:09:24,073 --> 00:09:29,579
That way, you can get rid of your
ridiculous feelings for him quicker, right?

82
00:09:32,148 --> 00:09:35,818
Lawyer Cha... I...

83
00:09:35,818 --> 00:09:38,021
I will work very hard as his lawyer,

84
00:09:38,021 --> 00:09:40,223
so that you will feel very burdened by it.

85
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,058
Starting from now, it's my case,

86
00:09:42,058 --> 00:09:43,526
so keep your hands out of it.

87
00:09:43,526 --> 00:09:44,994
Okay?

88
00:09:44,994 --> 00:09:45,728
What?

89
00:09:47,563 --> 00:09:49,032
Okay.

90
00:09:51,234 --> 00:09:53,436
Aja! Aja! Fighting!

91
00:10:13,256 --> 00:10:15,091
I feel like I'm going to die.

92
00:10:48,124 --> 00:10:49,225
<i>You see that, right?</i>

93
00:10:49,225 --> 00:10:50,693
<i>Pak Su Ha is telling an outrageous lie</i>

94
00:10:50,693 --> 00:10:53,262
<i>that he can read minds.</i>

95
00:10:53,262 --> 00:10:55,832
<i>Can we say that Pak Su Ha's allegations
</i>

96
00:10:55,832 --> 00:10:59,135
<i>are actually consistent and accurate?
</i>

97
00:11:01,337 --> 00:11:04,273
<i>Do you have any other evidence,
or maybe a witness?
</i>

98
00:11:14,183 --> 00:11:15,652
<i>Is there a problem?
</i>

99
00:11:16,753 --> 00:11:18,221
<i>I...</i>

100
00:11:18,588 --> 00:11:23,359
<i>I'm a witness for this murder case.
I'm Jang Hye Seong.
</i>

101
00:11:55,658 --> 00:11:59,329
Will I be able to win... this fight?

102
00:12:23,186 --> 00:12:26,489
Thank you.
If it wasn't for you today,

103
00:12:26,489 --> 00:12:29,058
there would have been no one to 
sign me out.

104
00:12:29,058 --> 00:12:30,526
I brought the car.

105
00:12:30,526 --> 00:12:32,729
I'll drop you off. Let's go.

106
00:12:32,729 --> 00:12:34,197
Yes.

107
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:46,309
Isn't this car a little wild?

108
00:12:46,309 --> 00:12:49,979
People like me not being compatible
with sports cars,

109
00:12:49,979 --> 00:12:51,814
that's an idea you need to throw out.

110
00:12:51,814 --> 00:12:52,181
It's not that.

111
00:12:52,181 --> 00:12:53,650
It's not that.

112
00:12:54,384 --> 00:12:56,586
Will this car even run?

113
00:12:56,586 --> 00:12:58,054
Of course!

114
00:12:58,054 --> 00:13:01,357
It hasn't broken down in the last 16 years.

115
00:13:02,091 --> 00:13:03,192
Get in.

116
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:27,784
The world has changed a lot.

117
00:13:29,252 --> 00:13:30,353
Don't worry.

118
00:13:30,353 --> 00:13:33,289
You'll catch up before you know it.

119
00:13:33,289 --> 00:13:34,390
I'm not so sure.

120
00:13:34,757 --> 00:13:38,795
I don't know if I'll have time to catch up.

121
00:13:41,731 --> 00:13:44,300
If I can just see my daughter before I die,

122
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,135
I won't have any regrets.

123
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,907
What's that?

124
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:56,779
This was in my bag 26 years ago
when I was arrested.

125
00:13:57,513 --> 00:13:59,716
It was a gift for Ga Eun.

126
00:14:02,285 --> 00:14:03,386
I'm sorry.

127
00:14:03,386 --> 00:14:04,854
For what?

128
00:14:04,854 --> 00:14:07,423
Just for everything.

129
00:14:07,423 --> 00:14:08,524
What are you talking about?

130
00:14:08,524 --> 00:14:10,727
I'm very grateful to you.

131
00:14:10,727 --> 00:14:17,333
You are the only person who 
believed in me.

132
00:14:26,509 --> 00:14:27,977
Is Prosecutor Seo inside?

133
00:14:27,977 --> 00:14:30,546
No. She's on an investigation in
Gapyeong right now.

134
00:14:30,546 --> 00:14:32,382
Investigation? What investigation?

135
00:14:32,382 --> 00:14:34,217
Something regarding Min Jun Guk.

136
00:14:34,217 --> 00:14:35,318
Min Jun Guk?

137
00:14:35,318 --> 00:14:39,355
But why would Prosecutor Seo 
investigate a dead person?

138
00:14:39,355 --> 00:14:43,393
I know. But it seems like she thinks
he might not be dead.

139
00:14:43,393 --> 00:14:45,962
What?

140
00:14:47,797 --> 00:14:51,100
I already told you, he's not here!

141
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,201
Really?

142
00:14:54,771 --> 00:14:56,239
Then, what about these?

143
00:14:56,239 --> 00:14:57,340
He's not there, Prosecutor!

144
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,542
How long are you going to keep 
doing this?

145
00:14:59,542 --> 00:15:01,744
Of course, until we find him.

146
00:15:01,744 --> 00:15:05,415
There must be a reason that person
didn't make the report himself.

147
00:15:06,883 --> 00:15:08,351
But speaking of that person,

148
00:15:08,351 --> 00:15:09,819
how were his hands?

149
00:15:10,186 --> 00:15:11,287
What?

150
00:15:11,287 --> 00:15:14,590
I said, his hands. Hands. How were they?

151
00:15:15,325 --> 00:15:17,894
Well, they were fine!

152
00:15:18,261 --> 00:15:20,096
Fine?

153
00:15:20,096 --> 00:15:24,500
Right. They were fine. 
What else would they be?

154
00:15:35,511 --> 00:15:36,612
You're home very late.

155
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:37,714
Have you eaten?

156
00:15:38,081 --> 00:15:38,815
If you haven't, we can eat...

157
00:15:38,815 --> 00:15:40,283
I've already eaten.

158
00:15:40,283 --> 00:15:42,118
Go see Lawyer Cha tomorrow.

159
00:15:42,118 --> 00:15:44,320
He's going to be your lawyer for 
the second trial.

160
00:15:45,788 --> 00:15:48,358
This is Lawyer Cha's contact details.

161
00:15:49,459 --> 00:15:50,927
You don't need to worry about money.

162
00:15:50,927 --> 00:15:53,129
He won't charge you.

163
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:57,900
Did you perhaps ask him to do it?

164
00:16:00,837 --> 00:16:02,671
Is that important?

165
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:04,873
Yes, it's important.

166
00:16:04,873 --> 00:16:07,443
Right. I did ask him.

167
00:16:07,443 --> 00:16:08,910
I'm sure you're already aware.

168
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:11,481
Do you think anybody else
is as good as Lawyer Cha?

169
00:16:13,315 --> 00:16:15,150
Although I do feel very sorry
and obligated to him for it,

170
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,352
I can't be involved in your case anymore.

171
00:16:17,719 --> 00:16:19,554
There's no other choice 
except for Lawyer Cha.

172
00:16:19,554 --> 00:16:21,024
You know?

173
00:16:21,024 --> 00:16:23,959
Okay. I'll go see him tomorrow.

174
00:16:24,327 --> 00:16:25,061
Go talk to him.

175
00:16:25,061 --> 00:16:26,896
Be polite.

176
00:16:33,102 --> 00:16:35,672
-=Law Office of Cha Gwan Wu=-

177
00:16:46,716 --> 00:16:49,285
I'm always worried about him.

178
00:16:49,285 --> 00:16:51,120
What's wrong with me?

179
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:56,993
I'm dying of hunger.

180
00:17:03,566 --> 00:17:05,401
-=Law Office of Cha Gwan Wu=-

181
00:18:24,347 --> 00:18:25,815
Over here!

182
00:18:29,118 --> 00:18:30,219
Do you want something to drink?

183
00:18:30,953 --> 00:18:32,789
I'll buy it myself.

184
00:18:34,991 --> 00:18:36,092
Fine.

185
00:18:40,496 --> 00:18:43,066
During this time, have you 
remembered anything else?

186
00:18:43,066 --> 00:18:47,470
Yes. First I remembered being at
the fishery with Min Jun Guk.

187
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:50,773
But what we talked about or what we did, 
I can't remember.

188
00:18:50,773 --> 00:18:52,975
You're sure you didn't fight with him?

189
00:18:53,343 --> 00:18:55,912
Yes. I don't remember that.

190
00:18:56,279 --> 00:18:58,848
You still haven't remembered anything
that seems helpful.

191
00:18:59,215 --> 00:19:00,683
Is there anything else?

192
00:19:00,683 --> 00:19:03,987
After I saw Min Jun Guk, I think I was
in a traffic accident.

193
00:19:03,987 --> 00:19:06,189
I think I remember it was on a road
near the dam.

194
00:19:06,556 --> 00:19:08,758
I was hit by a blue truck there.

195
00:19:08,758 --> 00:19:10,226
A blue truck?

196
00:19:10,226 --> 00:19:11,694
The 1-ton type?

197
00:19:11,694 --> 00:19:14,263
Yes, I think so.

198
00:19:14,998 --> 00:19:16,833
We need to find out about that.

199
00:19:17,567 --> 00:19:19,769
Do you possibly remember the 
license plate?

200
00:19:21,604 --> 00:19:24,173
So then I should look into the accident 
reports at nearby police stations.

201
00:19:24,173 --> 00:19:26,009
And hospital records.

202
00:19:28,578 --> 00:19:31,881
Thank you for taking this case.

203
00:19:31,881 --> 00:19:33,349
You don't need to thank me.

204
00:19:33,349 --> 00:19:35,551
I'm only doing it because Lawyer Jang
asked me.

205
00:19:37,754 --> 00:19:39,589
How much is your fee?

206
00:19:39,589 --> 00:19:41,424
You're not a public defender now, 
but a private lawyer,

207
00:19:41,424 --> 00:19:42,892
so there must be a fee, right?

208
00:19:43,993 --> 00:19:46,929
Kid, when I was a public defender,
I was free.

209
00:19:46,929 --> 00:19:49,499
But as a private lawyer, 
I'm very expensive.

210
00:19:49,499 --> 00:19:51,701
If I say I'm doing it for free, 
then you should just accept it.

211
00:19:52,068 --> 00:19:53,536
Put your energy into getting back
your memory.

212
00:19:53,903 --> 00:19:55,371
Please don't treat me like a child.

213
00:19:55,738 --> 00:19:57,206
I will pay your fee, so just tell me.

214
00:19:57,573 --> 00:19:59,042
Take Lawyer Jang out of this situation.

215
00:19:59,409 --> 00:20:02,345
My father left me a house and 
insurance money,

216
00:20:02,345 --> 00:20:03,446
so I can pay your fee.

217
00:20:03,813 --> 00:20:08,584
So, please don't burden Lawyer Jang
with any of this.

218
00:20:12,622 --> 00:20:16,659
Aren't you the one who is
burdening Lawyer Jang?

219
00:20:17,026 --> 00:20:19,962
Su Ha, you should stop playing an adult,

220
00:20:19,962 --> 00:20:21,798
and start acting like a real one.

221
00:20:21,798 --> 00:20:24,734
Wearing a suit doesn't make you an adult.

222
00:20:25,101 --> 00:20:28,771
Right now, you're just a high school
dropout and a murder suspect,

223
00:20:28,771 --> 00:20:30,239
with no memory and no future.

224
00:20:30,239 --> 00:20:32,442
That's why Lawyer Jang has taken you in.

225
00:20:32,442 --> 00:20:35,745
Don't mistake that for something else.

226
00:20:36,112 --> 00:20:39,048
<i>And also, I went easy on you a year ago
because you were young,</i>

227
00:20:39,415 --> 00:20:40,883
<i>but not anymore.</i>

228
00:20:40,883 --> 00:20:42,719
<i>When you get back your memories
and you get a not guilty verdict,</i>

229
00:20:42,719 --> 00:20:43,820
<i>don't burden Lawyer Jang any further,</i>

230
00:20:44,187 --> 00:20:45,655
<i>and move out of that house.</i>

231
00:20:45,655 --> 00:20:46,756
<i>Like you said, </i>

232
00:20:46,756 --> 00:20:48,958
<i>you're not a child anymore.</i>

233
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:59,602
I'm not any better.

234
00:20:59,602 --> 00:21:01,804
Because I feel so desperate,

235
00:21:02,171 --> 00:21:04,374
I have really hit rock bottom.

236
00:21:11,714 --> 00:21:14,651
Lawyer Shin. 
This Shim Wo Dal case,

237
00:21:14,651 --> 00:21:18,321
since she stabbed her husband because
he always beat her,

238
00:21:18,688 --> 00:21:21,624
can't we argue this as a self-defense case?

239
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,662
Lawyer Shin!

240
00:21:26,029 --> 00:21:28,231
Are you asleep?

241
00:21:28,598 --> 00:21:29,699
Just give it up.

242
00:21:29,699 --> 00:21:31,167
He's been doing that lately.

243
00:21:31,534 --> 00:21:31,901
Why?

244
00:21:32,268 --> 00:21:34,470
He's way past menopause, isn't he?

245
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:37,040
I can hear you.

246
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,875
If you heard what I said, 
then please tell me.

247
00:21:39,242 --> 00:21:42,545
This case... Could we win if we go
with reasonable self-defense?

248
00:21:42,545 --> 00:21:44,747
In this situation,

249
00:21:45,114 --> 00:21:49,519
I can scarcely remember any that
won going with self-defense.

250
00:21:49,886 --> 00:21:53,556
It's better just to plead guilty.

251
00:21:53,556 --> 00:21:56,492
Then you can argue for
a reduced sentence.

252
00:21:57,593 --> 00:22:00,163
But the defendant said she will 
take responsibility,

253
00:22:00,163 --> 00:22:01,631
and she wants me defend her 
as not guilty.

254
00:22:01,631 --> 00:22:03,466
Then convince her somehow.

255
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:06,035
You're the lawyer.

256
00:22:08,237 --> 00:22:10,440
I understand.

257
00:22:12,241 --> 00:22:13,710
-=Appeal=-

258
00:22:17,046 --> 00:22:18,514
<i>But speaking of that person,</i>

259
00:22:18,881 --> 00:22:19,983
<i>how were his hands?</i>

260
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:21,451
<i>What?</i>

261
00:22:21,818 --> 00:22:23,286
<i>I said, his hands. Hands. How were they?</i>

262
00:22:23,286 --> 00:22:25,855
<i>Well, they were fine!</i>

263
00:22:25,855 --> 00:22:28,057
<i>Fine?</i>

264
00:22:29,892 --> 00:22:37,233
Right. They were fine.
What else would they be?

265
00:22:45,308 --> 00:22:46,409
Chief Yang.

266
00:22:46,776 --> 00:22:48,244
I want to ask you something.

267
00:22:48,244 --> 00:22:50,813
How are Bo Hee's hands?

268
00:22:50,813 --> 00:22:52,649
Her hands?

269
00:22:53,383 --> 00:22:55,585
Pale and very pretty.

270
00:22:55,585 --> 00:22:56,319
Why?

271
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:57,053
Why?

272
00:22:57,053 --> 00:22:59,622
Bo Hee, how are Chief Yang's hands?

273
00:22:59,622 --> 00:23:03,660
Kind of thick and rough.

274
00:23:04,761 --> 00:23:08,798
Prosecutor Seo, have you finished
writing the appeal for the Pak Su Ha case?

275
00:23:08,798 --> 00:23:10,633
Ju seonbae.

276
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,468
What do you think of my hands?

277
00:23:12,835 --> 00:23:15,038
Your hands? I don't know...

278
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:19,442
your fingers are long and thin, 
aren't they?

279
00:23:19,442 --> 00:23:20,543
Right.

280
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:22,745
Whenever I ask anyone about hands,

281
00:23:23,112 --> 00:23:27,884
people describe them as
pale, pretty, thick, rough...

282
00:23:27,884 --> 00:23:29,352
they answer like that.

283
00:23:29,719 --> 00:23:33,389
But saying a hand is fine...

284
00:23:33,389 --> 00:23:35,224
that's a strange answer, isn't it?

285
00:23:35,224 --> 00:23:37,060
It's fine?

286
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,895
Someone answered like that?

287
00:23:38,895 --> 00:23:41,831
Yes. The person who reported Pak Su Ha,

288
00:23:42,198 --> 00:23:43,666
Mun Seong Nam.

289
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:47,337
I asked her about the hands on the 
person who told her about Pak Su Ha,

290
00:23:47,337 --> 00:23:50,640
But she answered that they were "fine."

291
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,475
Isn't that strange?

292
00:23:52,475 --> 00:23:55,044
Could it be... Min Jun Guk?

293
00:23:55,411 --> 00:23:57,246
If it's like what Pak Su Ha's side claims,

294
00:23:57,613 --> 00:23:59,082
and Min Jun Guk doesn't have a left hand...

295
00:23:59,449 --> 00:24:02,752
And if that lady is trying to protect
Min Jun Guk because he gave her the tip...

296
00:24:02,752 --> 00:24:04,587
She would answer that his hands 
were fine, right?

297
00:24:04,954 --> 00:24:07,890
Awesome!
No, wait...

298
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:08,992
If he were still alive,

299
00:24:08,992 --> 00:24:10,827
where has he been that we haven't 
found a trace of him?

300
00:24:10,827 --> 00:24:13,396
That's because we haven't really
been looking for him.

301
00:24:13,763 --> 00:24:15,965
Starting from now, I want to 
seriously look for him.

302
00:24:16,332 --> 00:24:17,433
Chief Yang.

303
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,003
Please serve Mun Seong Nam 
with a witness summons.

304
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:21,471
Okay.

305
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:28,077
Hyeong, do we have that kind of 
relationship?

306
00:24:28,444 --> 00:24:30,647
You just need to take a look at
the records.

307
00:24:30,647 --> 00:24:32,849
How much did I help you out 
when I was a police officer?

308
00:24:32,849 --> 00:24:34,684
=Ah, hyeong!=

309
00:24:34,684 --> 00:24:37,253
Stop your damn whining.

310
00:24:37,253 --> 00:24:40,556
What do you want to know?

311
00:24:40,556 --> 00:24:43,126
Last year on July 22nd or 23rd,

312
00:24:43,126 --> 00:24:46,062
do you have any reports regarding
traffic accidents?

313
00:24:46,429 --> 00:24:48,264
=Check for anything involving hitting
a person, or crashing into an object.=

314
00:24:48,264 --> 00:24:51,934
Last year, July 22nd or 23rd...

315
00:24:52,301 --> 00:24:54,871
2 incidents of a car hitting a person,
3 incidents of a car crashing into an object.

316
00:24:55,238 --> 00:24:57,807
Were any of them involving a blue truck?

317
00:24:58,174 --> 00:24:59,275
A 1-ton truck.

318
00:24:59,275 --> 00:25:01,477
Yeah, there's one.

319
00:25:01,844 --> 00:25:04,781
It occurred on a side road by the dam.

320
00:25:05,148 --> 00:25:08,084
Who was driving the truck?

321
00:25:08,818 --> 00:25:10,286
It says Gim Gi Ho.

322
00:25:10,653 --> 00:25:12,121
Gim Gi Ho?

323
00:25:12,121 --> 00:25:13,222
His address is...

324
00:25:13,589 --> 00:25:15,058
Ganghwa Island.

325
00:25:15,058 --> 00:25:16,159
That's right.

326
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:17,627
=How did you know?=

327
00:25:17,994 --> 00:25:19,095
Thank you, hyeong.

328
00:25:19,095 --> 00:25:20,930
Next time you have legal problems, 
just call me.

329
00:25:21,297 --> 00:25:24,233
I'll take care of you for free.

330
00:25:27,904 --> 00:25:30,473
Gim Gi Ho.

331
00:25:45,154 --> 00:25:46,990
Su Ha!

332
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:48,825
<i>Why are you in such a hurry?</i>

333
00:25:51,027 --> 00:25:54,330
From now on, don't call us here
as a set. I don't like it.

334
00:25:54,697 --> 00:25:57,266
I don't like it either, 
even more.

335
00:25:57,266 --> 00:25:57,633
I don't like it either,
even more.

336
00:25:59,102 --> 00:26:02,038
Why did you call today? 
Did you get back your memory?

337
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:05,341
No. So I think I need you guys
to help me.

338
00:26:05,341 --> 00:26:06,809
How can we help with that?

339
00:26:07,176 --> 00:26:10,847
Tell me everything you know about
Lawyer Jang and me.

340
00:26:15,985 --> 00:26:19,656
What's that? Are you interested
in the police academy?

341
00:26:20,023 --> 00:26:21,858
No. I was just looking at it.

342
00:26:21,858 --> 00:26:25,895
Dude, don't even look at it. 
It's really hard to get in there.

343
00:26:25,895 --> 00:26:27,363
Your case isn't even closed yet.

344
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:31,401
If you get found guilty, you won't be 
able to get in there in a million years.

345
00:26:32,135 --> 00:26:33,970
Is that right?

346
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:35,805
No, Su Ha can do it.

347
00:26:35,805 --> 00:26:38,007
You were a really good student
in high school.

348
00:26:38,007 --> 00:26:40,209
Really? That's surprising.

349
00:26:43,146 --> 00:26:45,348
Su Ha, if you became a police officer,
you'd look really handsome.

350
00:26:45,348 --> 00:26:47,550
I love men in uniforms.

351
00:26:48,651 --> 00:26:51,587
Our car center also has uniforms,
you know.

352
00:27:00,763 --> 00:27:04,434
It feels too awkward to 
eat with Su Ha.

353
00:27:05,168 --> 00:27:08,471
Should I just go eat by myself?

354
00:27:18,748 --> 00:27:20,950
That's mine.

355
00:27:26,823 --> 00:27:27,924
What are you doing?

356
00:27:28,658 --> 00:27:30,493
You're here?

357
00:27:34,897 --> 00:27:37,100
Lawyer Jang, why in the world
do you do this?

358
00:27:37,467 --> 00:27:40,403
It only confuses me and makes me dizzy.

359
00:27:40,403 --> 00:27:44,440
Really? When I go in there, 
it makes everything clear for me.

360
00:27:44,807 --> 00:27:47,010
I guess it doesn't work when 
you're older.

361
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:49,212
Why do you have to mention age?

362
00:27:49,212 --> 00:27:50,680
Has something been bothering you lately?

363
00:27:51,047 --> 00:27:52,515
It's not puberty, so what's going on?

364
00:27:52,882 --> 00:27:56,185
Do you have to go through puberty
for something to bother you?

365
00:27:58,755 --> 00:28:03,526
Oh, there's a new street diner.
When did that come?

366
00:28:04,627 --> 00:28:06,095
Are you going there?

367
00:28:06,095 --> 00:28:07,930
That's right!

368
00:28:09,766 --> 00:28:12,702
I thought you didn't drink anything
except wine.

369
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:18,574
Lawyer Jang, just go your own way
and keep your mouth closed!

370
00:28:21,144 --> 00:28:22,979
Let's go together!

371
00:28:29,218 --> 00:28:32,522
There must be something in the air today.

372
00:28:32,522 --> 00:28:36,192
I just ran into Prosecutor Seo in front 
of the courthouse and came over here.

373
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:40,229
Lawyer Shin and Lawyer Jang 
came, too.

374
00:28:40,229 --> 00:28:41,698
Have a seat.

375
00:28:42,065 --> 00:28:42,432
Sure.

376
00:28:42,432 --> 00:28:43,900
All right.

377
00:28:45,001 --> 00:28:47,203
Sit here.

378
00:28:51,974 --> 00:28:58,948
Prosecutor Seo can really drink! 
She's had 2 bottles of soju and is still sober.

379
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:03,353
Owner, 3 bottles of soju, please!

380
00:29:04,454 --> 00:29:05,188
<i>Okay!</i>

381
00:29:05,555 --> 00:29:08,858
What? 3 bottles?
Are you going to drink all that?

382
00:29:08,858 --> 00:29:11,794
You should know that I can
handle alcohol well.

383
00:29:13,629 --> 00:29:15,832
You can hold your alcohol?

384
00:29:22,071 --> 00:29:27,944
You see? I'm totally fine, right?

385
00:29:35,652 --> 00:29:38,955
Yes, you're just great.

386
00:29:39,689 --> 00:29:42,992
Prosecutor Seo, are you okay?

387
00:29:42,992 --> 00:29:46,295
Yes, I'm fine.

388
00:29:46,663 --> 00:29:49,966
But it's kind of hot in here.

389
00:29:49,966 --> 00:29:54,003
A sesame leaf and now lettuce.
That's quite a sight.

390
00:29:54,003 --> 00:29:59,876
Lawyer Jang, whenever I see you, 
there's something I wonder about.

391
00:30:00,243 --> 00:30:01,344
Ask me.

392
00:30:01,711 --> 00:30:05,748
When you were taking the public
defender interview,

393
00:30:06,115 --> 00:30:10,520
didn't you say you regretted going
into that courtroom to testify?

394
00:30:10,887 --> 00:30:14,190
Yes, I regret it.

395
00:30:14,924 --> 00:30:17,860
Why do you regret it?

396
00:30:18,227 --> 00:30:22,999
In fact, the reason I went to testify

397
00:30:23,733 --> 00:30:29,605
was just to show that awful girl 
and her father

398
00:30:29,605 --> 00:30:32,542
that I was right, and that girl was wrong.

399
00:30:32,946 --> 00:30:38,781
<i>1. 2. 3.</i>

400
00:30:38,781 --> 00:30:42,085
<i>That's why I opened the door and went in.</i>

401
00:30:42,085 --> 00:30:44,654
But I never got anything from that.

402
00:30:45,021 --> 00:30:46,856
Why haven't you gotten anything?

403
00:30:47,223 --> 00:30:51,995
Because you testified, you caught a 
criminal and upheld justice.

404
00:30:52,362 --> 00:30:57,500
Justice? That's bullshit.
That stupid cellphone.

405
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:00,069
The cellphone?

406
00:31:00,436 --> 00:31:03,373
<i>Pak Su Ha's testimony has lost credibility.
</i>

407
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:07,043
<i>Didn't you just hear what he said 
about reading minds?
</i>

408
00:31:07,043 --> 00:31:11,080
<i>Right now, he is lying to make sure 
this defendant is found guilty.</i>

409
00:31:11,447 --> 00:31:15,118
<i>It would be a little difficult to
call her as a witness.
</i>

410
00:31:22,825 --> 00:31:25,762
<i>I have a photo here.</i>

411
00:31:26,129 --> 00:31:30,533
<i>I took a picture of that man using
the metal pipe.
</i>

412
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:33,102
<i>Wouldn't that be called evidence?
</i>

413
00:31:33,469 --> 00:31:39,342
But because of that cellphone,
everything was for nothing.

414
00:31:39,709 --> 00:31:44,113
Everything was for nothing? Why?

415
00:31:55,124 --> 00:32:00,630
<i>You must have been scared, 
but you did very well.</i>

416
00:32:00,997 --> 00:32:07,603
<i>If not for you, this would have been
called just a simple traffic accident.</i>

417
00:32:08,705 --> 00:32:11,274
<i>Did you see the photo?</i>

418
00:32:11,641 --> 00:32:16,412
<i>I saw it. There was nothing there.</i>

419
00:32:23,019 --> 00:32:27,423
<i>The lie I told... will it be okay?</i>

420
00:32:27,423 --> 00:32:30,727
<i>Of course. You did well.</i>

421
00:32:30,727 --> 00:32:35,131
<i>When they're about to walk away in 
front of you, how can we just do nothing?</i>

422
00:32:35,498 --> 00:32:40,636
<i>Even if you have to shoot them with
a blank, you have to catch them.</i>

423
00:32:44,674 --> 00:32:46,876
<i>A blank?</i>

424
00:32:47,243 --> 00:32:54,217
<i>You did a good job today. I'll let you 
know when the verdict comes out.</i>

425
00:32:54,584 --> 00:32:58,988
<i>Did you know? 
There was another witness.</i>

426
00:33:01,924 --> 00:33:04,494
<i>Who is it?</i>

427
00:33:04,494 --> 00:33:06,328
<i>Do Yeon.</i>

428
00:33:06,328 --> 00:33:09,632
<i>What? Do Yeon?</i>

429
00:33:09,999 --> 00:33:13,302
<i>At the time that it happened, 
she was with me.</i>

430
00:33:13,302 --> 00:33:16,973
<i>So she was supposed to come here
today with me,</i>

431
00:33:17,707 --> 00:33:19,909
<i>but she ran away.</i>

432
00:33:20,276 --> 00:33:22,478
<i>Do Yeon is a liar.</i>

433
00:33:22,845 --> 00:33:27,984
<i>About today, and about the fireworks too.</i>

434
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:35,325
<i>I know. Do Yeon did tell a lie.</i>

435
00:33:36,058 --> 00:33:40,830
<i>But because of that, I knew you
were the culprit. </i>

436
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:42,665
<i>Ajussi! That's...
</i>

437
00:33:43,031 --> 00:33:47,804
<i>I believe something like that 
isn't really a lie,</i>

438
00:33:47,804 --> 00:33:51,841
<i>whether it was Do Yeon,
or what you did just now.</i>

439
00:33:52,208 --> 00:33:55,143
<i>If it's not a lie, then what is it?</i>

440
00:33:55,511 --> 00:33:58,815
<i>A blank.</i>

441
00:33:58,815 --> 00:34:02,852
<i>Firing a blank to catch a criminal.</i>

442
00:34:14,964 --> 00:34:20,837
<i>I felt it was really unfair. 
For the sake of my honor, </i>

443
00:34:21,204 --> 00:34:27,810
just to prove I was right...
I ended up risking my life.

444
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:30,747
But I never got anything for it.

445
00:34:31,114 --> 00:34:32,949
Only...

446
00:34:35,151 --> 00:34:40,289
a sworn enemy to haunt my life.

447
00:34:42,492 --> 00:34:46,162
How about it? 
You think I should regret it, right?

448
00:34:46,529 --> 00:34:52,402
Regret? 
Was your regret as much as mine?

449
00:34:53,136 --> 00:34:57,173
I also have regrets.

450
00:34:57,173 --> 00:35:01,944
For over 11 years, I have been 
regretting that I didn't open that door.

451
00:35:01,944 --> 00:35:05,615
Then, Prosecutor Seo is that awful...

452
00:35:05,615 --> 00:35:07,817
You're that girl?

453
00:35:07,817 --> 00:35:08,184
You're that girl?

454
00:35:10,019 --> 00:35:14,424
Do you know why I hated you so much?

455
00:35:19,195 --> 00:35:20,865
1.

456
00:35:20,865 --> 00:35:23,232
2.

457
00:35:23,232 --> 00:35:28,738
3.

458
00:35:28,738 --> 00:35:35,345
<i>Because you witnessed the most 
pathetic moment of my entire life.</i>

459
00:35:35,345 --> 00:35:42,318
<i>Every time I see you, I think of 
that damn moment.</i>

460
00:36:02,872 --> 00:36:08,011
<i>Do you have any idea how much 
I have regretted that?</i>

461
00:36:08,011 --> 00:36:10,947
<i>I always wished I could go back to 
that moment and be a witness. </i>

462
00:36:11,314 --> 00:36:17,553
<i>That moment, even now,
I still regret it.</i>

463
00:36:20,123 --> 00:36:27,096
<i>I wanted to somehow make up
for that moment.</i>

464
00:36:29,298 --> 00:36:34,804
From that day on, I gave up my art
and cut myself off from my friends.

465
00:36:35,171 --> 00:36:38,107
I did nothing but study so that I
could become a prosecutor.

466
00:36:38,841 --> 00:36:42,512
I wanted you and father to see...

467
00:36:42,512 --> 00:36:48,751
that I wasn't me that day. 
That I made a mistake.

468
00:36:48,751 --> 00:36:55,358
I've been doing everything for
11 years just to justify that.

469
00:36:55,725 --> 00:36:59,762
Do you know that?
For 11 years!

470
00:37:07,837 --> 00:37:10,039
I'll be leaving first.

471
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:11,507
Prosecutor Seo.

472
00:37:11,874 --> 00:37:14,811
Prosecutor Seo, you can't just 
leave like this!

473
00:37:19,215 --> 00:37:24,354
I'll be leaving too.

474
00:37:24,721 --> 00:37:28,024
Lawyer Jang! Lawyer Jang!
You're just leaving...

475
00:37:28,024 --> 00:37:32,795
Lawyer Jang! What will we do when the 
people who drank the most leave?

476
00:37:33,896 --> 00:37:35,365
<i>Pay your bill!</i>

477
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,136
<i>When I met you here, I was curious.
</i>

478
00:37:40,503 --> 00:37:45,274
<i>Such a big-time prosecutor,
why did I,</i>

479
00:37:45,274 --> 00:37:47,110
<i>just a public defender, 
have to run into you?
</i>

480
00:37:48,578 --> 00:37:52,248
<i>Why did fate have such a sick sense of 
humor to make us meet like this?</i>

481
00:37:58,121 --> 00:38:02,525
That's an interesting friendship.
Those two people.

482
00:38:02,525 --> 00:38:09,132
I know what you mean. I didn't know
they had that kind of history.

483
00:38:09,132 --> 00:38:11,701
But to actually meet each other again as 
prosecutor and lawyer.

484
00:38:11,701 --> 00:38:17,573
No kidding. Life is full of coincidences, 
right?

485
00:38:17,573 --> 00:38:22,345
Like they say, coincidences are 
carefully planned by heaven.

486
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:34,824
<i>If heaven arranges for two people
to see each other again, </i>

487
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:45,468
<i>don't you think there must be a reason 
they needed to come together again?</i>

488
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:16,299
<i>Right now, you're just a high school
dropout </i>

489
00:39:16,299 --> 00:39:18,868
<i>and a murder suspect,
with no memory and no future.</i>

490
00:39:18,868 --> 00:39:21,070
<i>That's why Lawyer Jang has taken you in.</i>

491
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:24,007
<i>Don't mistake that for something else.</i>

492
00:39:48,965 --> 00:39:50,433
Why are those shoes there?

493
00:39:55,571 --> 00:39:57,407
These are Lawyer Jang's clothes.

494
00:40:29,706 --> 00:40:32,642
<i>Aren't you the one who is
burdening Lawyer Jang?</i>

495
00:40:50,259 --> 00:40:51,728
Seo Do Yeon, you bad girl.

496
00:41:25,495 --> 00:41:26,963
What is this scar?

497
00:42:03,299 --> 00:42:05,501
I think you drank a lot last night.
Are you all right?

498
00:42:05,868 --> 00:42:06,969
I'm fine.

499
00:42:08,805 --> 00:42:11,741
Can't you just not drink? It doesn't 
seem like you hold it very well.

500
00:42:11,741 --> 00:42:13,943
My drinking ability is well known.

501
00:42:14,677 --> 00:42:18,715
I've always come back home to sleep
and never caused any trouble.

502
00:42:18,715 --> 00:42:20,550
So, you don't need to worry.

503
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:26,055
Aren't you going to eat today?
I made bean sprout soup.

504
00:42:26,055 --> 00:42:28,992
I have some things to do early today.

505
00:42:32,295 --> 00:42:33,763
Aren't you just avoiding me?

506
00:42:35,231 --> 00:42:36,699
No, I'm not.

507
00:42:51,014 --> 00:42:52,482
What are you doing?

508
00:42:52,482 --> 00:42:53,950
I have something to ask you.

509
00:42:54,684 --> 00:42:55,785
What's that?

510
00:42:55,785 --> 00:42:59,088
I saw the scar on your side.
What's that from?

511
00:42:59,822 --> 00:43:02,392
<i>If he finds that out, it will be 
painful for him.</i>

512
00:43:04,227 --> 00:43:07,163
When did you see that?
It's just from an appendix surgery.

513
00:43:07,897 --> 00:43:08,998
An appendix surgery?

514
00:43:08,998 --> 00:43:11,567
Yes, an appendix surgery. Okay?

515
00:43:12,669 --> 00:43:14,137
One more thing.

516
00:43:16,339 --> 00:43:20,009
Whatever I have to do, I'm going to get 
acquitted. After I get acquitted, 
I'm going to college.

517
00:43:20,009 --> 00:43:22,945
Then I will make friends and get a
part-time job and work hard.

518
00:43:22,945 --> 00:43:25,515
I won't be a burden to you, 
so you don't have to worry.

519
00:43:25,515 --> 00:43:26,983
I will do my best.

520
00:43:27,717 --> 00:43:31,020
Really? That sounds pretty good.

521
00:43:31,387 --> 00:43:35,425
I won't nag you anymore. I won't annoy
you or make things hard for you.

522
00:43:35,425 --> 00:43:36,893
That sounds pretty good, too.

523
00:43:36,893 --> 00:43:40,196
So, don't avoid me.

524
00:43:40,196 --> 00:43:42,398
Don't come home late to avoid me,

525
00:43:42,398 --> 00:43:43,866
or skip your meals.

526
00:43:46,069 --> 00:43:47,904
And don't hate me.

527
00:44:48,464 --> 00:44:51,034
<i>It's the same bag.</i>

528
00:44:51,034 --> 00:44:52,135
<i>She's so damn annoying.</i>

529
00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:03,880
<i>Justice? That's bullshit. </i>

530
00:45:04,247 --> 00:45:05,715
<i>That stupid cellphone.</i>

531
00:45:06,816 --> 00:45:09,752
<i>I said that? Damn, damn, damn!</i>

532
00:45:12,322 --> 00:45:15,992
<i>I also have regrets.</i>

533
00:45:16,359 --> 00:45:20,763
<i>For over 11 years, I have been
regretting that I didn't open that door.</i>

534
00:45:22,231 --> 00:45:23,333
Darn it.

535
00:45:34,711 --> 00:45:36,546
Do you remember anything yesterday
after drinking?

536
00:45:36,546 --> 00:45:39,115
Not a thing. 
What about you?

537
00:45:39,115 --> 00:45:42,051
Me either. Not a thing.

538
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:50,860
So now that Prosecutor Seo 
is calling me in as a witness.

539
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:53,429
Aigoo. She's really stubborn.

540
00:45:55,631 --> 00:46:00,036
Don't worry. When I go, 
I won't say a word about you.

541
00:46:00,403 --> 00:46:02,238
When do they want you to come?

542
00:46:02,238 --> 00:46:03,339
Tomorrow.

543
00:46:03,339 --> 00:46:06,275
I guess I'll have to close the
business tomorrow.

544
00:46:09,579 --> 00:46:14,717
Oh, Right. Here are a few peaches
you can take with you to eat.

545
00:46:16,185 --> 00:46:17,654
Thank you, Boss.

546
00:46:20,957 --> 00:46:22,425
<i>What's this?</i>

547
00:46:22,425 --> 00:46:25,728
<i>I saw on your resume that
today is your birthday.
</i>

548
00:46:26,462 --> 00:46:29,766
<i>So I made you some seaweed soup
and some side dishes.
</i>

549
00:46:29,766 --> 00:46:31,601
<i>Take it home and eat it.
</i>

550
00:46:32,335 --> 00:46:35,271
<i>You should already know what I'm
going to do.
</i>

551
00:46:35,638 --> 00:46:36,739
<i>Aren't you afraid?</i>

552
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:45,915
<i>I'm not afraid. I only feel that you're 
worthless and I pity you.</i>

553
00:46:46,282 --> 00:46:49,585
<i>Living all those years only hating others.
</i>

554
00:46:51,054 --> 00:46:53,990
<i>Your life must have been a living hell.
</i>

555
00:46:58,027 --> 00:46:59,495
What are you thinking about?

556
00:46:59,862 --> 00:47:05,001
I'm just... thinking about what to do.

557
00:47:05,001 --> 00:47:09,405
Whether I should just give up here, 
or keep going to the end.

558
00:47:10,506 --> 00:47:11,974
Are you traveling?

559
00:47:13,810 --> 00:47:18,948
Traveling? Yes, I'm traveling.

560
00:47:19,682 --> 00:47:22,986
But now that I'm here, 
this spot is pretty good.

561
00:47:22,986 --> 00:47:26,289
Whether I should just stop here...

562
00:47:27,757 --> 00:47:29,225
that's what I'm wondering.

563
00:47:29,225 --> 00:47:32,895
But since you said you're traveling, 
shouldn't you go all the way to the end?

564
00:47:33,629 --> 00:47:37,667
Should I? You think so too, Boss?

565
00:47:37,667 --> 00:47:40,603
If you're traveling, then you
need to finish it.

566
00:47:42,805 --> 00:47:47,210
That's right.
I have to go to the end.

567
00:47:51,614 --> 00:47:53,082
I think so, too.

568
00:48:14,370 --> 00:48:15,471
Truck?

569
00:48:38,594 --> 00:48:41,898
<i>After I saw Min Jun Guk, I think I was
in a traffic accident.</i>

570
00:48:41,898 --> 00:48:44,100
<i>I think I remember it was on a road
near the dam.</i>

571
00:48:44,467 --> 00:48:46,669
<i>I was hit by a blue truck there.</i>

572
00:48:48,504 --> 00:48:49,972
Bingo.

573
00:48:52,542 --> 00:48:54,010
Who are you?

574
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:58,781
Hello, Elder.

575
00:48:58,781 --> 00:49:00,984
I have a few things I need to ask
you about.

576
00:49:06,856 --> 00:49:08,691
That's sweet and really tasty.

577
00:49:09,792 --> 00:49:11,627
What is it you want to ask me?

578
00:49:13,463 --> 00:49:17,133
You know Pak Su Ha, right?
No...

579
00:49:17,133 --> 00:49:19,702
You called him Lee Seun Uk, right?

580
00:49:19,702 --> 00:49:24,474
Why this again? I already told the 
police and the prosecutor.

581
00:49:24,474 --> 00:49:26,676
They already investigated me.

582
00:49:27,410 --> 00:49:30,713
It's because now we have some new
information that we didn't know before.

583
00:49:31,447 --> 00:49:32,915
What's that?

584
00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:36,586
Elder, by any chance, one year ago... 
did you with that truck...

585
00:49:36,586 --> 00:49:38,788
Pak Su Ha... No...

586
00:49:39,522 --> 00:49:41,357
hit Lee Seun Uk with it?

587
00:49:42,091 --> 00:49:44,661
Who said that?
Did Seun Uk say that?

588
00:49:45,762 --> 00:49:47,230
Does he remember that now?

589
00:49:49,065 --> 00:49:50,900
Yes. He said he remembered that.

590
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:53,102
So, you can tell me the truth about it now.

591
00:49:53,102 --> 00:49:55,672
Why did you hide him after the accident?

592
00:49:56,406 --> 00:50:00,810
After you hit a person, you reported 
that you ran into an object.

593
00:50:01,177 --> 00:50:05,214
Actually, I was planning to report the
accident and take responsibility.

594
00:50:05,214 --> 00:50:06,683
Truly!

595
00:50:08,151 --> 00:50:11,454
But that person told me not to do it.

596
00:50:11,454 --> 00:50:14,023
That since that child had lost his memory,

597
00:50:14,023 --> 00:50:15,858
I just shouldn't tell anyone.

598
00:50:15,858 --> 00:50:19,162
Who was that person?

599
00:50:33,109 --> 00:50:35,311
- Hello?
- =Prosecutor, there's a problem!=

600
00:50:35,311 --> 00:50:38,614
The witness who we summoned, 
Mun Seong Nam...

601
00:50:38,614 --> 00:50:41,918
Last night, she was killed in a car accident.

602
00:50:42,285 --> 00:50:44,120
What?

603
00:50:57,700 --> 00:50:58,801
What happened?

604
00:50:58,801 --> 00:51:00,269
They said it's drunk driving.

605
00:51:00,269 --> 00:51:01,371
She was coming this way from 
over there,

606
00:51:01,371 --> 00:51:02,472
and then she went over the bridge.

607
00:51:02,472 --> 00:51:03,940
She died instantly of a broken neck.

608
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:05,408
It was drunk driving?

609
00:51:05,408 --> 00:51:07,977
Yes. Her blood alcohol level was 0.19%.

610
00:51:07,977 --> 00:51:09,812
She was extremely drunk.

611
00:51:10,913 --> 00:51:12,749
Have you looked at the CCTV?

612
00:51:12,749 --> 00:51:13,850
Yes.

613
00:51:13,850 --> 00:51:16,052
But it was out of order.

614
00:51:16,052 --> 00:51:18,254
Not only that, it broke only
1 hour before the accident.

615
00:51:20,089 --> 00:51:21,557
A witness against Min Jun Guk,

616
00:51:21,557 --> 00:51:23,760
who just received a summons,

617
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,595
suddenly dies of a drunk driving accident?

618
00:51:25,595 --> 00:51:29,265
In addition, the CCTV malfunctions
1 hour before the accident.

619
00:51:29,265 --> 00:51:29,999
In addition, the CCTV malfunctions
1 hour before the accident.

620
00:51:29,999 --> 00:51:31,467
Do you think all that is coincidence?

621
00:51:31,467 --> 00:51:34,037
It's not coincidence. No way.

622
00:51:35,505 --> 00:51:38,808
Starting now, we're going to say
Min Jun Guk is still alive.

623
00:51:38,808 --> 00:51:41,010
Put Min Jun Guk on the wanted list.

624
00:51:41,010 --> 00:51:42,478
Yes.

625
00:51:49,819 --> 00:51:51,654
<i>What is that scar?</i>

626
00:51:51,654 --> 00:51:55,325
This looks a lot like her scar.

627
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:19,549
This... this...
what's going on?

628
00:52:19,549 --> 00:52:21,017
That can't be.

629
00:52:21,017 --> 00:52:23,219
Why would you?

630
00:52:23,219 --> 00:52:27,623
<i>Why? Why did you?</i>

631
00:52:28,358 --> 00:52:33,129
<i>Hey, Rice Pot. 
How many times did I tell you?</i>

632
00:52:33,129 --> 00:52:37,166
<i>If you kill that man...
you won't be the victim any more, 
</i>

633
00:52:37,166 --> 00:52:39,369
<i>but the murderer.
</i>

634
00:52:40,837 --> 00:52:44,874
<i>Don't say a word about this, ever.</i>

635
00:52:44,874 --> 00:52:47,076
<i>You didn't stab me.</i>

636
00:52:47,076 --> 00:52:48,544
<i>If you ever say anything else, </i>

637
00:52:48,544 --> 00:52:52,582
<i>I'm never... going to see you again.</i>

638
00:53:12,769 --> 00:53:17,907
<i>I'm a witness for this murder case.
I'm Jang Hye Seong.
</i>

639
00:53:17,907 --> 00:53:25,615
<i>I will... protect you.</i>

640
00:53:27,083 --> 00:53:30,386
<i>Uncle! I'm over here!
</i>

641
00:53:34,791 --> 00:53:37,360
<i>It hurts!</i>

642
00:53:51,307 --> 00:53:53,876
<i>I can read other people's minds.
</i>

643
00:54:13,329 --> 00:54:15,164
Stop!

644
00:54:15,898 --> 00:54:18,835
<i>You think your father was a good man, 
don't you?</i>

645
00:54:52,602 --> 00:54:57,373
<i>Just as I killed your father,</i>

646
00:54:57,373 --> 00:55:02,879
<i>your father killed my wife.</i>

647
00:55:03,246 --> 00:55:05,448
No.

648
00:55:05,448 --> 00:55:07,283
It's not possible.

649
00:55:07,283 --> 00:55:10,953
<i>No. It's not possible.</i>

650
00:55:10,953 --> 00:55:16,459
<i>You think your father was a good man,
don't you?</i>

651
00:55:16,826 --> 00:55:19,395
<i>That's enough! Shut up!
Quit lying!</i>

652
00:55:19,395 --> 00:55:24,901
<i>You know that I'm not lying to you
right now.</i>

653
00:55:24,901 --> 00:55:28,938
<i>Stop. Please.</i>

654
00:55:28,938 --> 00:55:31,507
<i>Your father...</i>

655
00:55:31,507 --> 00:55:37,013
<i>with that treacherous tongue, 
he killed my wife.</i>

656
00:55:37,013 --> 00:55:42,151
<i>The one who started all of this wasn't me!</i>

657
00:55:42,151 --> 00:55:44,354
<i>It was your father!</i>

658
00:55:44,354 --> 00:55:46,923
<i>Shut up! Shut up!</i>

659
00:55:49,492 --> 00:55:51,694
<i>Right.</i>

660
00:55:53,896 --> 00:55:57,567
<i>I know you want to kill me right now.</i>

661
00:55:57,567 --> 00:56:00,503
<i>Kill me. Go ahead and kill me.</i>

662
00:56:01,971 --> 00:56:09,312
<i>How are you any different than 
I was 11 years ago?</i>

663
00:56:15,551 --> 00:56:21,424
<i>I will never do the thing you're
worried about.</i>

664
00:56:21,424 --> 00:56:28,031
<i>I promise you I'll keep my word. 
Please trust me. 
</i>

665
00:56:44,914 --> 00:56:47,483
<i>I am different.</i>

666
00:56:48,584 --> 00:56:53,356
<i>I won't live as a beast like you.</i>

667
00:56:53,356 --> 00:56:56,292
<i>Ever.</i>

668
00:57:02,165 --> 00:57:04,734
<i>Stop! Pak Su Ha!</i>

669
00:57:04,734 --> 00:57:07,303
<i>Stop right there!</i>

670
00:57:13,176 --> 00:57:17,947
<i>Father, please tell me it isn't true.</i>

671
00:57:18,314 --> 00:57:21,985
<i>Father! Father!</i>

672
00:57:30,059 --> 00:57:33,363
Kid, how can you just run out like that?

673
00:57:34,097 --> 00:57:35,932
<i>If I show weakness I'll be at a
disadvantage.</i>

674
00:57:35,932 --> 00:57:38,501
<i>I need to come on tough.</i>

675
00:57:40,703 --> 00:57:44,741
Are you trying to get killed? 
Are you blind?

676
00:57:49,145 --> 00:57:51,714
<i>Why was he like that?
That driver was at fault. </i>

677
00:57:51,714 --> 00:57:54,283
<i>- This is a sidewalk. 
- Why didn't he say anything?</i>

678
00:57:54,283 --> 00:57:56,119
<i>- Should we call the police?
- What's going on?</i>

679
00:57:56,119 --> 00:57:59,789
<i>- Really annoying.
- Why are there so many people?</i>

680
00:58:30,987 --> 00:58:35,391
Lawyer Jang! Lawyer Jang!
Min Jun Guk is still alive!

681
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:38,328
Yes. I just heard that.

682
00:58:40,530 --> 00:58:42,365
Prosecutor Seo, why are you here?

683
00:58:42,365 --> 00:58:45,668
I also confirmed that fact,
that Min Jun Guk is still alive.

684
00:58:45,668 --> 00:58:47,870
How did you find out?

685
00:58:47,870 --> 00:58:50,073
The grandpa that was hiding 
Pak Su Ha for that year,

686
00:58:50,073 --> 00:58:53,743
he was drinking and driving, and hit
Pak Su Ha with his truck a year ago.

687
00:58:53,743 --> 00:58:55,578
Is that why he kept him?

688
00:58:55,578 --> 00:58:57,780
Just to hide his drunk driving accident?

689
00:58:57,780 --> 00:59:00,350
He originally wanted to go to the police, 
but someone prevented him.

690
00:59:00,350 --> 00:59:03,286
He told him to keep it buried, 
because Pak Su Ha had lost his memory.

691
00:59:03,286 --> 00:59:04,387
Don't tell me...

692
00:59:04,387 --> 00:59:05,488
It was Min Jun Guk.

693
00:59:05,488 --> 00:59:09,525
He said Min Jun Guk was already
missing his left hand.

694
00:59:09,525 --> 00:59:15,031
My gosh, then Min Jun Guk 
really did stage all of this.

695
00:59:16,132 --> 00:59:18,334
Where is Min Jun Guk now?

696
00:59:18,334 --> 00:59:22,739
We're not sure. We have issued
an arrest warrant for him.

697
00:59:22,739 --> 00:59:26,409
I've told the police in the region to
canvass the area for him.

698
00:59:26,409 --> 00:59:28,244
I'm checking into a retaliation crime 
prevention strategies,

699
00:59:28,244 --> 00:59:30,446
so don't be scared.

700
00:59:30,446 --> 00:59:34,117
What about Su Ha?
What about Su Ha's appeal case?

701
00:59:34,117 --> 00:59:35,218
What?

702
00:59:35,218 --> 00:59:36,686
Since Min Jun Guk is still alive,

703
00:59:36,686 --> 00:59:38,888
Su Ha's case should be dropped,
shouldn't it?

704
00:59:38,888 --> 00:59:41,090
Hey. Is that important in this 
situation right now?

705
00:59:41,090 --> 00:59:45,495
Yes, it comes first. 
You'll drop the charges, right?

706
00:59:46,596 --> 00:59:49,165
Yes, I will.

707
00:59:49,165 --> 00:59:51,000
Thanks.

708
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,835
I'm going out for a while.

709
00:59:53,936 --> 00:59:55,038
Where are you going?

710
00:59:55,038 --> 00:59:57,240
To tell Su Ha.

711
01:00:12,655 --> 01:00:17,794
<i>The one who started all of this wasn't me!</i>

712
01:00:17,794 --> 01:00:21,097
<i>It was your father!</i>

713
01:00:22,932 --> 01:00:28,438
That's what it was...
the memory I wanted to erase.

714
01:00:28,438 --> 01:00:32,475
But erasing it won't make it go away.

715
01:00:45,688 --> 01:00:48,624
<i>What should I do with you?</i>

716
01:00:48,624 --> 01:00:53,029
<i>If you knew this, you'd hate me more.</i>

717
01:00:53,029 --> 01:00:55,598
<i>If you knew Min Jun Guk was still alive,</i>

718
01:00:55,598 --> 01:00:58,901
<i>how scared would you be?</i>

719
01:00:58,901 --> 01:01:02,205
<i>Min Jun Guk is still alive.
Su Ha didn't kill him. </i>

720
01:01:02,205 --> 01:01:05,875
<i>That guy really did keep his 
promise to me.</i>

721
01:01:12,849 --> 01:01:14,317
Hello?

722
01:01:14,317 --> 01:01:17,620
Hey, where are you now? At home?

723
01:01:19,088 --> 01:01:21,658
No, I came out for a while.

724
01:01:21,658 --> 01:01:25,328
Min Jun Guk is alive.  Seo Do Yeon
and Lawyer Cha found out.

725
01:01:25,328 --> 01:01:27,163
Okay.

726
01:01:27,163 --> 01:01:29,732
What's that reaction?
I said Min Jun Guk is alive!

727
01:01:29,732 --> 01:01:33,036
You're now completely innocent and
you won't have another trial!

728
01:01:33,036 --> 01:01:35,972
That person is alive.

729
01:01:35,972 --> 01:01:38,541
That means that you're in danger.

730
01:01:38,541 --> 01:01:40,743
Hey, Rice Pot! 
We'll deal with that later.

731
01:01:40,743 --> 01:01:44,047
Seo Do Yeon said she's going to drop
the charges against you. I heard it myself.

732
01:01:44,047 --> 01:01:45,515
So, you're not a defendant anymore...

733
01:01:45,515 --> 01:01:47,717
So, you're not a defendant anymore...

734
01:01:48,084 --> 01:01:49,919
Hey!

735
01:01:50,653 --> 01:01:53,589
You're the rice pot.

736
01:01:54,691 --> 01:01:57,994
Your life is being threatened again.

737
01:01:57,994 --> 01:02:00,930
How can me being innocent come first?

738
01:02:00,930 --> 01:02:03,866
How can you think that?

739
01:02:15,979 --> 01:02:20,750
Thanks... for keeping your promise.

740
01:02:29,892 --> 01:02:35,031
~ <i>It's like you're in my distant memory</i> ~

741
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:42,372
~ <i>waiting there for me</i> ~

742
01:02:43,473 --> 01:02:50,813
~ <i>You beckon to me like a whisper</i> ~

743
01:02:50,813 --> 01:02:53,016
~ <i>Deep in my heart, </i> ~

744
01:02:53,016 --> 01:02:54,851
<i>deep in my soul,</i>

745
01:02:54,851 --> 01:02:58,521
~ <i>your voice deep within me,</i> ~

746
01:02:58,521 --> 01:03:11,367
~ <i>I hear it</i> ~
